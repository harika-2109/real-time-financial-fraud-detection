# Real-Time Financial Fraud Detection

## Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning–based fraud detection system
to identify fraudulent financial transactions while minimizing false alerts.

The project was developed as part of a college Innovation Challenge in collaboration
with a financial institution and is inspired by real-world fraud detection problems.

## Problem Statement
Financial institutions face challenges where:
- Fraudulent transactions are increasing
- Genuine transactions are incorrectly blocked
- High false positives create poor customer experience

The goal is to improve fraud detection accuracy while reducing unnecessary alerts.

## Approach
- Worked with historical transaction data
- Performed feature engineering to capture behavioral patterns
- Trained machine learning models to classify fraud
- Evaluated models using precision and recall
- Simulated real-time transaction scoring

## Technologies
- Python
- Machine Learning
- Feature Engineering
- GitHub
